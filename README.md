Welcome to my GIS Tutorial Series! I'm Ahmed Giwa, and I bring over 15 years of hands-on GIS experience working with industry leaders across multiple continents namely the United Kingdom, the Middle East and North America working with the Local Governments, Renewable Energy Industry, Utilities and, the Pipelines sector. I am excited to share the insights and skills I gained with you. 

Whether you’re new to GIS or seeking to enhance your skills, this course offers a balanced approach to mastering the basics of spatial data, map visualization, and essential analysis techniques.

Starting with the basics, each module builds on the last, covering essential topics like working with vector and raster data, editing and managing attributes, performing spatial analyses, and creating polished map layouts. As the course progresses, learners explore more advanced features like network analysis, geocoding, terrain modeling, and even Web GIS for online map publishing. This course is ideal for those looking to master GIS from the ground up or take their existing skills to the next level.
