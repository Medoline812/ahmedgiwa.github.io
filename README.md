Starting with the basics, each module builds on the last, covering essential topics like working with vector and raster data, editing and managing attributes, performing spatial analyses, and creating polished map layouts. As the course progresses, learners explore more advanced features like network analysis, geocoding, terrain modeling, and even Web GIS for online map publishing.
